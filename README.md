### Ollie Javascript Controller ###

This small project is to allow control of the Sphero Ollie either from node/javascirpt or from Webpage/Javascript

It is very much a work in progress

### How do I get set up? ###

You need to install the Bluez stack, the node stack

I am using a Raspberry Pi, note there are some issues with the node stack on the latest release, so you'll have to work out what works for you

then clone the repo, running the webserver just needs node wwwr.

I am using vs2013 as a dev environment on my windows machine, but apart from the sln etc it's just a plain old node/socket/express etc project
